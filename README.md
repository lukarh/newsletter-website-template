# newsletter-website-template

## About

The purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with MERN stack and how it can be incorporated while developing a website that runs on essential user functionalities and making the user experience a smooth one. I also wanted to created a template / beginning framework to build upon for a possible newsletter website later on in the future if needed. Overall, I am fully responsible for fullstack developing and designing this template website from scratch using MERN stack for client, server, and database interaction. This website also utilizes API endpoints using Express.JS, Passport.JS, and Axios for seamless integration and communication with the server and MongoDB for various user functionalities such as Login/Logout, User Authentication, and User Account Management. I also designed the front-end user experience utilizing PrimeReact, a React UI component library, and also custom styled components. Furtermore, I use publicly available development tools such as Stripe, Mailtrap, and NewsAPI to gain familiarity on how to integrate subscription services, emailing services, and a public news database onto the website. In the future, I plan to further streamline and clean out the process for how the entire website operates.
